# Animated Verbs

Site: [https://animatedverbs.com](https://animatedverbs.com)

This is a personal, just-for-kicks project that utilizes the [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org/) library to animate characters in verbs as a representation of their action. This started off as three separate CodePen ideas and this repo is the collection of those parts.

The original parts:

* CodePen Collection: [https://codepen.io/collection/XKEvEV](https://codepen.io/collection/XKEvEV)
* Part one: [https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/MWgbqON](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/MWgbqON).
* Part two: [https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/OJLxWKq](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/OJLxWKq)
* Part three: [https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/oNvMLRQ](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/oNvMLRQ)
